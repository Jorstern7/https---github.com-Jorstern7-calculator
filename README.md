This calculator App has been developed especially for transcription tasks and/or any other tasks that can be calculated based on some rate per minute. 
Say Good Bye to the headache of multiplying the amount of second with the rate per minute and having to divide it by 60. This calculator can make even more complex calculations than this: accounting for that same previous calculation in addition to the number of minute and hour at the same time is no big deal. It will simply operate all this at once and give you the total of the price for your budget.

Who is this calculator for?

Anyone wishing to save time when preparing invoices for clients, and who performs transcription services or any tasks that can be charged per minute can have this calculator prominently installed in their computer for professional use.
  This calculator is also for employers who would like to know the total cost of their project(s) based on their proposed rate per minute before hiring their preferred client.
